Hockey Stick: The tool used to shoot, pass, and control the puck. Sticks come in various lengths, flexes (stiffness), and lies (blade angle) to suit different playing styles and positions.

Shoulder Pads: Absorb impact and protect the shoulders, chest, collarbone, and spine from forceful contact with other players or the boards.

Elbow Pads:  Protect the elbows from impacts during falls or collisions.

Gloves: Padded gloves safeguard the hands from injuries from flying pucks and stick contact.

Shin Pads: Protect the shins, knees, and calves from impacts with the puck, sticks, or other players.

Jock Strap (for Men) or Protective Brief (for Women): Provides essential protection for the groin area.

Hockey Pants: Padded pants offer protection for the thighs, hips, and tailbone.
